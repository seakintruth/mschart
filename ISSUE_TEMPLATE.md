Issues are a great way to keep track of tasks, enhancements, and bugs for your projects (https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). When submitting, you need to provide the 
following elements:

### Reporting a bug:

- [ ] The code that is producing the error, it has to be a minimal reproducible example.
Stackoverflow is providing good explanations about it: https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve. You can use package `reprex` to help you: http://reprex.tidyverse.org/. The most popular R stackoverflow question is about the subject: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5963269/how-to-make-a-great-r-reproducible-example.

- [ ] the results of R command `sessionInfo()`. It had to be executed after you loaded the packages used by your example. This will let me know what is your version of R and what are the versions of the packages you used in your example. 

- [ ] you did checked you had the latest version of the package on CRAN (and on github if issue exists with CRAN version).

- [ ] you searched in the *open* and *closed* issues on the github repository.


### Asking an enhancement or a new function

Explain the value, describe the situation.

Any suggestions to make the documentation better is really appreciated.

### Asking a question

If you are looking for help on how to use the package, please visit Stackoverflow and tag your 
question with `[r]` and `[mschart]`. I usually read them and answer when possible.
